# Decision log: v2 autonomous build

Audit trail for assumptions, deviations, dependency changes, and assertion
changes made during the v2 run. One entry per decision, tagged with the
milestone it belongs to.

## Milestone 1

### M1: Registry metadata lives outside the Scenario type

The milestone requires a registry with id, name, tagline, difficulty label,
and estimated step count, but also requires that engine and types stay
untouched except where the registry requires it. Difficulty is presentation
metadata, not simulator behavior, so it is defined in
`data/scenarios/index.ts` as a registry-level field rather than added to the
`Scenario` type. Step count is derived from `scenario.steps.length` instead
of being stored, so it cannot drift from the data.

### M1: "Estimated step count" interpreted as exact step count

All current scenarios have a fixed linear spine, so the step count is exact,
not estimated. The registry exposes it as `stepCount` and derives it from
the data. If a future scenario branches into paths of different lengths,
this field is the natural place to widen into a range.

### M1: Redirect implemented with the framework redirect helper

`/simulator` redirects to scenario 1 using `redirect()` from
`next/navigation` in a server page. This was verified against the build
output to confirm the route still prerenders statically and the app stays
deployable with no server requirements.

### M1: Reducer resolves the scenario from state

The simulator reducer looks up the scenario by `state.scenarioId` through
the registry instead of closing over a scenario prop. This keeps the reducer
a module-level pure function (stable across renders) and works for any
number of scenarios without changing the engine.
